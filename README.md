Best Practices to follow for having a great user experience in your software

### User Experience
How a person feels about interacting with my application
OR More appropriately put
The measure of friction between a user and their goal
(Cognitive, Emotional Physical)

### Desired Result
Happy Satisfied Productive

Measure cognitive friction whenever making UX changes

### Things that can adverse affect(increase) cognitive friction.
- How much visual noise does the screen have?
For example do you really need fancy headers, screen titles, logos, lots of visible meanus (Horizontal or vertical)

- Showing all fields by default. 
Users generally need very few fields to get the job done. Now they are wasting their energy to find where are their desired fields. 
They are doing a lot of scrolling.
Each time a user scrolls, the brain has to reprocess all the information and then try to find out what they want is there.

- Navigation helpers are generally mostly ignored.

- Save button not visible
Users had to scroll to find out where is the save button.
Now you know why Google Docs have auto save.


## BECOME a UX Hacker

### User Cantered thinking
### UX Professionals research
- Who the user is
- What the user needs (not wants)
- Create a design that delivers great user experience based on research
- Put the user at the center of every decision you make
- We are not the user
- Does the decision I make benefit the user or me ?

### Identify and confront biases
- 104+ cognitive biases, check out RSOAP, a visual study guide to Cognitive Biases
- Biases shape our thinking and decision making
- They can derail our efforts on UX
- It is very important ot identify and confront our own biases

### 7 Bad developer biases

-Bias Blind Spot
Not compensating for one's own cognitive bias. You can knock this over if you acknowledge that you have biases.

- Professional Bias

The tendency to look at things according to conventions of one's own profession. While putting your solutions use more terminology that general users understand rather than your own technical jargons.

- Semmelweis Reflex

The tendency to reject new evidence that contradicts an established paradigm. Have an open mind to new ideas and suggestions in order to get away from this reflex.

- Bandwagon effect

The tendency to do things because many other people do the same. Through forums or communities senior developers actually influence many people at once. Always ask why in order to get away from this bias.

- Confirmation Bias

The tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions. This comes when you have strong opinion about something and then you search for and filter information based on what you believe. It is ok to admit that we have our own opinions and ideas, but you should be open to evaluate other ideas.

- Status Quo Bias 

The tendency for people to like things to stay relatively the same. Key to overcome this is to step out of your comfort zone and look to what is outside.

- Reactance

The urge to do opposite of what someone wants you to do. Because of a perception of losing control.



### Who are we?
- We are developers.
- We are problem solvers by nature.
- We solve technical puzzles.
- We see the world differently.
- We see only the tech and ignore the human part

### Changing our behavior
- Changing behavior can be hard but possible
- Coding for a new platform
- Human Brain
- Better decisions
- Avoid Common traps

### Common Mistakes
- Throwing Data on the screen (Doing what's easier for us and not what's best for user). User is interested in information and not pile of data you throw around.

- Exposing Technology jargons to the user (Not using regular english). Always use human friendly language and terminology that end user understands.

- Forcing user to think like database administrators. Talking about transactions, commits and other technical terms.

- Messy UI - Using excuse that I am not good at UI.

- Being inconsistent (Calling one button save and in another screen calling it submit), having varying margins, non aligned form fields.

- Coding for the Expert User (Avoid the hard work of making something easy to use by using expert user excuse)

- Coding for edge cases (Working to solve non existent problems)
