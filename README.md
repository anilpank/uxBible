Best Practices to follow for having a great user experience in your software

### User Experience
How a person feels about interacting with my application
OR More appropriately put
The measure of friction between a user and their goal
(Cognitive, Emotional Physical)

### Desired Result
Happy Satisfied Productive

Measure cognitive friction whenever making UX changes

### Things that can adverse affect(increase) cognitive friction.
- How much visual noise does the screen have?
For example do you really need fancy headers, screen titles, logos, lots of visible meanus (Horizontal or vertical)

- Showing all fields by default. 
Users generally need very few fields to get the job done. Now they are wasting their energy to find where are their desired fields. 
They are doing a lot of scrolling.
Each time a user scrolls, the brain has to reprocess all the information and then try to find out what they want is there.

- Navigation helpers are generally mostly ignored.

- Save button not visible
Users had to scroll to find out where is the save button.
Now you know why Google Docs have auto save.
